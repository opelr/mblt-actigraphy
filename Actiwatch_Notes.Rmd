## Watch Properties

* Sampling Freq.: 256Hz
    + Does that mean a 2-minute bin has a physical maxima of 30720? (256 $\times$ 60 $\times$ 2)
* Accelerometer Sensitivity: 0.01 g's
* Band Pass Filter: 3 - 11 Hz

## Scoring

* Activity $\Rightarrow A = 0.04E_{−2} + 0.2E_{−1} + 1E_{0} + 0.2E_{+1} + 0.04E_{+2}$ where $E_0$ is the epoch being scored.

    + Lotjonen_Wake is very conservative with sleep prediction --> let's try the more general regression instead of the "middle aged"
